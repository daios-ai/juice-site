# Keep this script simple and easily auditable.
#
# It downloads one released tarball holding Juice-UI's three programs (juice-ui, juice-chat and
# juice-supervisor), refuses it unless it matches the published checksum, and puts them in
# $JUICE_HOME/bin (default ~/.juice/bin). Nothing is installed system-wide, nothing asks for a
# password, and nothing is started. The rest of Juice, the kernel and the agent, is installed by
# juice-ui itself on its first start, at the releases it was verified against.
#
# Everything runs inside main, called on the last line, so a connection that breaks midway through
# `curl | sh` cannot leave half of this script executed.

Install Juice-UI.

Usage:
  install.sh [VERSION] [--no-modify-path]
  curl -fsSL <url>/install.sh | sh -s -- [VERSION] [--no-modify-path]

  VERSION            a release tag from the releases page; the latest release by default
  --no-modify-path   do not touch any shell profile; print what to add instead
  -h, --help         print this help

Environment:
  JUICE_HOME         where Juice keeps everything (default ~/.juice); the programs
                     go in its bin/ subdirectory. Must be an absolute path. The
                     installer never writes it to a shell profile: a home chosen
                     for one run is set by whoever runs juice-ui, every time.
